                <p>"I've been a bank teller for 15 years, but everything changed when we switched to Euros this January. After handling hundreds of notes daily, I started having the strangest dreams. Mario Draghi was standing in my bedroom, just watching me. Then he would open a ledger and start writing down numbers.</p>
                
                <p>By the third week, I found myself unconsciously arranging the Euro notes in my cash drawer into strange patterns. My colleagues are doing it too, but none of them will talk about it. Sometimes I catch us all humming the same melody - it sounds like the European anthem but distorted somehow.</p>
                
                <p>Last week, I caught myself staring at Draghi's signature for over 30 minutes during my lunch break. I only snapped out of it when my supervisor touched my shoulder. She whispered 'It's happening to you too, isn't it?' then walked away.</p>
                
                <p>I'm scared. I've started wearing rubber gloves to handle the money, and the dreams have reduced slightly. <span class="highlight">THERE IS SOMETHING IN THOSE SIGNATURES!</span>"</p>

                <p>"As a frequent business traveler across Europe, I carry substantial amounts of Euros. Around March, I began experiencing unusual symptoms. It started with increased support for European monetary policies - strange for me, as I'd been a critic!</p>
                
                <p>Then came the dreams. I see vast networks of glowing blue lines connecting all Euro users, with all lines leading to a central figure I now recognize as Draghi. In the dreams, he's collecting some kind of energy from every transaction.</p>
                
                <p>The most disturbing incident happened during a business meeting in Brussels. I was presenting fiscal projections when I suddenly went off-script and started passionately advocating for expanded ECB powers. My colleagues were shocked, and so was I - it wasn't what I intended to say at all!</p>
                
                <p>I've since started converting my Euros to Swiss Francs whenever possible, and the symptoms have decreased. I keep my remaining Euros in a lead-lined wallet I ordered from your shop. <span class="highlight">IT'S HELPING!</span>"</p>

                <p>"I'm a simple housewife who manages our family budget. Since switching to Euros, I've noticed strange behaviors in my family. My husband, who never cared about economics, now watches ECB announcements religiously. My teenage son has put up a poster of the Euro symbol in his room!</p>
                
                <p>As for me, I've started having recurring dreams where I'm in a giant vault filled with Euro notes. All the notes are vibrating slightly, and when I look closely, each signature is glowing. The signatures seem to be pulsing in unison, like a heartbeat.</p>
                
                <p>The worst part is that I've caught myself arranging our household budget to match the pattern of stars on the Euro flag. I didn't even realize I was doing it until my sister pointed it out!</p>

                <p>"As an economics student, I was excited about analyzing the Euro implementation. For my thesis, I decided to examine the psychological impacts of currency transitions. Little did I know I would become my own case study.</p>
                
                <p>After handling various Euro notes extensively for my research, I began experiencing intense dreams about monetary policy. These weren't normal academic dreams - they were vivid experiences where I could actually FEEL Draghi's presence guiding my thinking.</p>
                
                <p>During one study session, I found myself unconsciously drawing his signature over and over in my notebook. When I looked at what I'd drawn, I noticed the signatures formed a perfect star pattern matching the EU flag. I have no artistic ability - this precision was impossible for me normally!</p>
                
                <p>The most convincing evidence came when I conducted a blind study. I gave 20 fellow students either regular Euros or special ones where I had carefully placed transparent tape over Draghi's signature. Those using the covered-signature Euros reported 70% fewer monetary dreams! <span class="highlight">THE SIGNATURE IS THE KEY!</span>"</p>

                <p>"I've lived through many currency changes in my 78 years, but none has affected me like the Euro. At first, I was just confused by the new money, as any old timer would be. But then the dreams started.</p>
                
                <p>In these dreams, I'm young again, standing in a great hall with thousands of others. We're all holding Euros up to the light, examining them. At the front of the hall stands Draghi, but he's dressed like a medieval alchemist. He's teaching us something about the money, something important, but when I wake up I can never quite remember what it was.</p>
                
                <p>The strangest part is that I've never seen Draghi in real life or on television - I don't follow politics or banking news! But when I saw his picture on your website, I recognized him immediately from my dreams. How could I dream so vividly of a man I've never seen?</p>
                
                <p>My grandson gave me one of those wallet protectors you recommend. I was skeptical, but the dreams have become less frequent. Still, sometimes I feel the Euros vibrating slightly in my pocket. <span class="highlight">THERE'S SOMETHING NOT RIGHT ABOUT THESE NEW COINS AND BILLS!</span>"</p>

                <p>"Working as a cashier means I handle hundreds of Euros every shift. About two weeks after the Euro launch, I started having persistent headaches whenever I worked the register. Then the whispering started.</p>
                
                <p>It's hard to describe, but sometimes when the store is quiet, I can hear faint whispers coming from the cash drawer. It sounds like economic terminology, interest rates, fiscal policy concepts - things I've never studied or understood!</p>
                
                <p>My coworkers think I'm crazy, but four other cashiers have admitted to me privately that they're experiencing the same thing. One of them drew what she 'hears' - it was a perfect replica of Draghi's signature, though she claims she's never noticed it on the bills!</p>
                
                <p>Last week, I requested to be moved to the stock room. The headaches stopped immediately. When my manager asked why I wanted to change positions, I found myself unable to tell him the truth - almost as if something was preventing me from speaking about it. <span class="highlight">IS THE INFLUENCE TRYING TO PROTECT ITSELF?</span>"</p>

                <p>"My 6-year-old son has never shown any interest in money or economics. He doesn't even have an allowance yet. But last month, he started drawing the same person in all his pictures - a man in a suit with what looks like stars around his head.</p>
                
                <p>When I asked who it was, he said 'The Money Man who talks to everyone while they sleep.' I was puzzled until I saw your website. The figure in his drawings is undeniably Draghi!</p>
                
                <p>Last week, I found him arranging his toys in a circle around a Euro coin. When I asked what game he was playing, he said, 'The Money Man said to make a power circle.' I removed the Euro and replaced it with his old toy coin, and he immediately lost interest in the game.</p>
                
                <p>Children are more sensitive to these influences! I've now removed all Euros from our home and keep them in a special container in the garage. My son's drawings have returned to normal. <span class="highlight">PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN FROM EURO EXPOSURE!</span>"</p>
