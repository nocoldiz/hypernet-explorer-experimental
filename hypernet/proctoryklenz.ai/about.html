             class="profile-pic">

        <p>
            <b>Proctor V. Klenz</b> serves as the Supreme Proctor and Chief Ontological Hygienist for the esteemed Order of Radiant Purity. His seminal work in the field of Metaphysical Chemistry and Hyper-Dimensional Hygiene has established him as a leading authority on the mitigation of existential contaminants and the protocols necessary for spiritual ascension. Holding a Ph.D. from the Esoteric University of Applied Purity (EUAP), Proctor Klenz's doctoral research focused on the vibrational frequencies of common cleaning agents and their potential impact on psycho-spiritual resonance fields.
        </p>

        <p>
            Prior to his groundbreaking doctoral work, Proctor Klenz obtained a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Janitorial Sciences, where his early investigations into surface-level impurity removal hinted at the deeper, ontological 'stains' that permeate lower-frequency realities. This foundational understanding proved critical in the development of his later theories concerning spiritual sterilization.
        </p>

        <h2>Principal Contributions & Research Areas</h2>

        <p>
            Proctor Klenz's most significant contribution is the formulation of the <b>Klenz Postulate</b>. This postulate posits that the specific molecular structure and resultant energetic signature of Sodium Hypochlorite (NaClO) act as a universal solvent for ontological grime, effectively neutralizing the negative vibrational patterns that bind consciousness to impure physical forms. His research rigorously documents the 'cleansing effect' on astral particulates and weak-force contaminants.
        </p>

        <p>
            Current research initiatives under Proctor Klenz's direct supervision include:
            <ul>
                <li>Advanced protocols for consciousness buffering and migration via Purity Fields.</li>
                <li>Spectrographic analysis of Hyper-Dimensional residues pre- and post-NaClO application.</li>
                <li>Development of resonant tuning forks calibrated to the primary frequency of NaClO for meditative alignment.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Selected Publications <img src="[PLACEHOLDER_NEW_TAG_GIF]" alt="New!" class="new-gif"></h2> 
        
        <p>
            Proctor Klenz has authored numerous articles in specialist journals and is credited with several key monographs in the field. Notable works include:

**Key Features:**

1.  **Doctorate Style Content:** Uses formal language ("seminal work," "ontological," "mitigation," "postulate," "spectrographic analysis"), fake credentials (Ph.D., B.Sc. Hons.), lists research areas and publications with academic-style citations.
2.  **Web 1.0 Aesthetics:**
    * Classic gray background (`#C0C0C0`) with a white content box.
    * System fonts (`Times New Roman`, `Arial`).
    * Fixed-width container (`650px`).
    * Simple borders (`groove`, `solid`, `dashed`).
    * Basic image alignment and border.
    * Justified text (`text-align: justify;`).
    * Minimalist structure.
    * Includes a placeholder for a "New!" GIF next to publications.
    * Fake "Last Updated" date in the footer using a 90s format.
3.  **Placeholders:** Remember to replace `[PLACEHOLDER_PROCTOR_KLENZ_PHOTO.JPG]` with a suitable image URL (or find/create one!) and `[PLACEHOLDER_NEW_TAG_GIF]` with an actual animated "New!" GIF.
