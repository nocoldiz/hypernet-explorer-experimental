Margaret,

Your assessment is correct. The spring equinox approaches and our window
narrows. I have reviewed the Guild records and Em's natural affinities 
make her the obvious choice - her lunar attunement and natural shields 
will actually PROTECT her during the working, though she needn't know 
the technical details.

The key is framing this as a "group blessing ritual" for the Guild's 
prosperity. Em's generous nature will ensure participation.

Propose we schedule for March 20th, new moon. I will handle the 
preparatory invocations.

Yours in the Work,
Alister

Alister,

Excellent. The economic implications of a successful Solomon working 
cannot be overstated - the Guild's influence in financial markets will 
be considerably enhanced.

I agree Em is ideal. Her raw power coupled with her... shall we say, 
trusting disposition... creates perfect conditions. The dear girl has 
such faith in our collective wisdom.

I will arrange the Circle logistics. Suggest we brief her minimally - 
tell her it's about "channeling abundance energies for Guild expansion."
Technical magical jargon tends to confuse her anyway.

Regards,
Margaret

P.S. - Do ensure the binding protocols are properly established. We 
cannot afford any... unexpected outcomes.

Hi everyone!!!

Margaret told me about the big Guild blessing ritual and I am SO 
excited!!! ðŸŒ™âœ¨ (sorry, I know we're supposed to keep emails plain 
text but I had to!)

I've been sensing such amazing energies building lately - the crystals 
in my workshop have been practically HUMMING! And my tarot cards keep 
showing the Star card which is like, totally about hope and spiritual 
gifts and stuff.

I would be absolutely HONORED to help channel abundance for our Guild 
family! I've been working on my grounding techniques like Alister 
suggested, and I think I'm finally ready for a really big working.

Should I bring my amethyst collection? And what about sage for 
cleansing? I have this gorgeous white sage from California that just 
arrived!

Also - silly question maybe - but why is it called the Solomon ritual? 
Is it like, related to King Solomon's wisdom or something? I tried 
looking it up in the Guild library but Cornelius said those books are 
"above my pay grade" LOL!

Anyway, THANK YOU for including me! This is going to be amazing!!!

Blessed be,
Em ðŸŒ¸

Margaret,

Perfect. Em's enthusiasm will only strengthen the working. Her natural 
shields are so strong she genuinely won't feel the true nature of what 
we're doing until it's complete.

Regarding her questions - I suggest we stick to the "wisdom of Solomon" 
angle. Technically accurate, if incomplete. The poor dear needn't know 
we're specifically invoking the 72 Demons of the Goetia for market 
manipulation purposes.

Her crystal collection will actually be helpful - natural focusing aids.
Allow her to bring whatever makes her comfortable.

The timing remains critical. New moon in 11 days. I will begin the 
preliminary seal work tonight.

A.C.

P.S. - Have you secured the necessary "insurance policy" documents from 
Legal? If the working goes poorly, we need liability coverage.

Alister,

Legal documentation is sorted. Em has signed what she believes is a 
standard "group ritual participation waiver." She was so excited she 
barely read it.

I must admit, I have some lingering concerns about the scope of this 
working. The potential for economic gains is substantial, but Solomon's 
bindings are notoriously... temperamental. Are we certain Em's natural 
defenses will hold?

Perhaps we should have Cornelius on standby with emergency banishing 
protocols?

Also, I've arranged for the ritual space - the old Guild vault beneath 
Threadneedle Street. Appropriate symbolism, and the wards are already 
established.

M.T.

P.S. - I do hope Em never discovers the true nature of what we're 
attempting. She has such a trusting heart.

Guild family!

I can barely sleep I'm so excited about tomorrow night! I spent the 
whole day preparing - meditation, fasting (well, mostly fasting, I had 
a tiny bit of chocolate), and charging my crystals under the starlight.

I keep having the most vivid dreams about golden light and ancient 
voices. Is that normal before big rituals? The voices keep saying 
something in Latin but my Latin is pretty rusty from school LOL.

I brought my grandmother's silver chalice like Margaret suggested, and 
I've prepared some special moon water blessed during the last full moon.

I have to ask though - why do we need to meet in the old vault? It's so 
dark and spooky down there! Wouldn't the main temple upstairs be better 
for channeling positive abundance energies?

Also, Cornelius looked really serious when he handed me that pendant to 
wear. He said something about "protection" but it felt more like a 
warning? I'm probably just being silly though!

See you tomorrow at midnight! This is going to be AMAZING!

Love and light,
Em âœ¨

P.S. - Should I be worried that the Guild librarian keeps giving me sad 
looks? And why did he mutter "poor child" when he saw me today?
