        <div class="coordinates">Coords: 39.7391°N, 119.7670°W</div>
        <div class="observation">First contact. Spotted subjects in modified camper van (designation: THE BEAST). Em appears to be documenting something. Bubba working on strange device under hood. Van emits unusual neuro-static readings.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">Note: My stealth-car's optical-cloak is holding. They have no idea I'm here. This is just the beginning.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">1995.09.03</div>
        <div class="location">Location: Route 66, Arizona</div>
        <div class="coordinates">Coords: 35.0844°N, 108.7414°W</div>
        <div class="observation">Subjects stopped at diner. Em writing furiously in journal. Bubba's device (possibly liminal-engine?) caused all electronic devices in 50m radius to malfunction. Local authorities investigating "atmospheric anomaly."</div>
        <div class="personal-note">Had to restart stealth-car's neural-core three times. Whatever Bubba built, it's interfering with standard cogni-tech.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">1996.01.18</div>
        <div class="location">Location: Interstate 40, Oklahoma</div>
        <div class="coordinates">Coords: 35.4676°N, 97.5164°W</div>
        <div class="observation">BREAKTHROUGH: Subjects encountered time-loop phenomenon. Witnessed same 4-hour period repeat 3 times. Em seemed to retain memories between loops. Bubba's device allowed them to escape on third iteration.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">I'm trapped in the loops too. Writing this for the third time. If you're reading this, I escaped. The neuro-dampeners are the only thing keeping me sane.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">1996.08.22</div>

        <div class="coordinates">Coords: 36.2704°N, 121.8075°W</div>
        <div class="observation">Subjects visited location designated "MYSTERY SPOT." Em's abilities manifested visibly - observed reality distortion within 10m radius. Local quantum-field readings off the charts.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">The stealth-car's reality-anchor saved me from getting caught in Em's reality-flux. She's getting stronger.</div>

        <div class="coordinates">Coords: 39.7392°N, 104.9903°W</div>
        <div class="observation">CRITICAL EVENT: The Squishing occurred. Reality compressed. 92 dimensions collapsed into one. Subjects seemed prepared - their van transformed, gained new defensive capabilities. Em's power levels spiked exponentially.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">Nearly lost them in the chaos. Stealth-car barely survived the dimensional collapse. Thank God for the cogni-shield upgrades.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">1997.11.09</div>

        <div class="coordinates">Coords: 39.3210°N, 110.7624°W</div>
        <div class="observation">Post-Squishing world stabilizing. Subjects now traveling the Encompassing Road. Witnessed them interact with trucker convoy - appear to be part of larger network. Bubba's beast can now traverse dimensional pockets.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">Had to upgrade stealth-car again. The new reality requires neural-adaptation protocols. Following them is becoming increasingly dangerous.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">1998.06.07</div>

        <div class="coordinates">Coords: [DATA CORRUPTED]</div>
        <div class="observation">Followed subjects into what they call a "scrap of creation." Witnessed landscape that defies standard physics. Em communicated with entities I couldn't identify. Bubba's liminal-engine evolved, now incorporates what appears to be living metal.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">My stealth-car is changing too. It's adapting to this post-Squishing reality. Sometimes I think it's becoming sentient.</div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">1999.01.01</div>
        <div class="location">Location: Road to Beagle, Entry Point Alpha</div>
        <div class="coordinates">Coords: [CLASSIFIED]</div>
        <div class="observation">Y2K event. Magic returned to world in full force. Witnessed Em perform Solomon Ritual - confirmed she was instrumental in YHWH termination event. Bubba provided technical support via liminal-engine interface.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">The world changed today. Everything we knew about reality is obsolete. My mission parameters have updated automatically. Must continue surveillance.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">1999.07.20</div>
        <div class="location">Location: Valencia (New Continent)</div>
        <div class="coordinates">Coords: [DIMENSIONAL COORDINATES UNAVAILABLE]</div>
        <div class="observation">Subjects explored new landmass. Em investigated falling body bags phenomenon. Bubba made contact with ultra-wealthy refugees. Both seemed disturbed by what they found. Departed after 3 days.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">Valencia gives me the creeps. Even with full stealth-mode, I felt watched. Something in that place doesn't want observers.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">2000.04.12</div>
        <div class="location">Location: City of Ghosts, Valencia</div>
        <div class="coordinates">Coords: [SPECTRAL MAPPING REQUIRED]</div>
        <div class="observation">Subjects entered ghostly metropolis. Em unaffected by spectral residents. Bubba resisted their golden temptations. Woman in silver robes warned them of "coming storm." They escaped through hidden passage.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">Nearly lost stealth-car to the ghosts. They can't see me, but they can sense technology. Had to run silent for 6 hours.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">2000.09.08</div>
        <div class="location">Location: Hyper-Capitalist Territory</div>
        <div class="coordinates">Coords: [MOVING TARGET - SPEED VARIABLE]</div>
        <div class="observation">Subjects encountered Hyper-Capitalist collective pursuit team. High-speed chase through multiple time zones. Em's abilities kept them ahead of bio-enhanced pursuers. Bubba's beast demonstrated new velocity-phase capabilities.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">This was the closest I've come to losing them. My stealth-car can barely keep up with their evolved vehicles.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">2001.01.15</div>
        <div class="location">Location: Approaching Beagle City Limits</div>
        <div class="coordinates">Coords: [FLUCTUATING - REALITY UNSTABLE]</div>
        <div class="observation">Subjects reached Beagle. City appeared different to each of them - Em saw technological utopia, Bubba saw frontier town. Their perceptions shaped local reality. Stayed only 2 hours before departing suddenly.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">Beagle nearly broke my mind. Stealth-car's cogni-filters working overtime. Whatever they found there scared them. That scares me.</div>

    <div class="entry">
        <div class="date">2001.02.28</div>
        <div class="location">Location: Unknown Desert Region</div>
        <div class="coordinates">Coords: [SHIFTING LANDSCAPE]</div>
        <div class="observation">Subjects camped near ancient ruins. Em performed memory-diving ritual. Bubba maintained protective perimeter with enhanced tech. Found evidence of pre-Squishing civilization. Both seemed to gain important information.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">The ruins affected my stealth-car's systems. Ancient tech interfacing with modern cogni-circuits. I think we're all changing.</div>

        <div class="observation">MISSION CRITICAL: Subjects have arrived at Archive Foundation headquarters. Massive tower complex visible on horizon. Em and Bubba proceeding on foot toward main entrance. This appears to be their destination.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">Six years of following them has led to this moment. The Omega Tower... I've heard whispers about this place in hypernet forums. They're going inside.</div>

        <div class="personal-note">They know. After six years, they finally know I'm here. Em looked directly at my position before entering the tower. She smiled.</div>

        <div class="observation">END OF SURVEILLANCE LOG. Subjects have entered Archive Foundation. Mission parameters complete. Awaiting new instructions.</div>
        <div class="personal-note">The road ends here. Whatever happens next, I won't be watching. Em and Bubba... I almost feel like I know them. Six years of shadows and they never knew my name. Maybe that's for the best.</div>
