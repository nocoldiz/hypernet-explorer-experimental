        <h1>Southern Mama's Guide to Vibe Coding</h1>
        <p>Where Faith, Family, and Frontend Come Together</p>
    </header>
    
    <div class="container">
        <div class="intro">
            <p>Well bless your heart for stopping by! I'm Meredith Sue Jenkins, mama of three beautiful children, church bake sale coordinator, and recently concerned about this newfangled thing called "vibe coding" that my eldest has gotten himself into. After much prayer and several Pinterest deep-dives, I've created this little corner of the internet to help other mamas navigate these technological waters.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "The good Lord didn't give us dial-up internet just so our babies could waste their time on bad vibes!"
        </div>
        
        <h2>What in Tarnation is Vibe Coding?</h2>
        <p>Now y'all, from what I understand after many conversations with my son Tyler (between his deep sighs), vibe coding is when these young folks program their computers based on feelings and aesthetics instead of that logical stuff they're supposed to use. They're making websites and apps look all dreamy and moody - sometimes with colors that don't even match! Can you imagine?</p>
        
        <p>Instead of focusing on making their code "efficient" or "scalable" (words Tyler keeps using while I nod and refill his sweet tea), these kids are more concerned with how the program feels. It's like they're decorating their digital bedrooms without cleaning them first!</p>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>MAMA'S WARNING SIGN #1</h3>
            <p>If your child starts talking about "aesthetics" more than "algorithms" - they might be vibe coding! Next thing you know, they'll be using fonts that nobody over 40 can read without their bifocals!</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Why This Mama is Concerned</h2>
        <p>Now don't get me wrong - I'm all for creativity. My kitchen has had three different rooster themes in the past decade alone! But there's a time and place for everything under heaven, and I'm worried our children won't be prepared for the real world if they're too focused on vibes.</p>
        
        <p>My Tyler's computer teacher, Mr. Rodriguez (such a nice man, makes a wonderful pecan pie for the faculty potluck), says that traditional coding teaches discipline and structure. Vibe coding might be leading our children down a path where they expect work to always be fun and personally fulfilling. Bless their hearts, that's just not how life works!</p>
        
        <div class="bible-verse">

        </div>
        
        <h2>Signs Your Child Might Be Vibe Coding</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>They've bought LED strip lights for their room (Tyler has his set to purple - LORD HELP ME)</li>
            <li>They use words like "aesthetic," "mood," and "energy" when describing their homework</li>
            <li>Their computer background is a sunset or anime character instead of something sensible like a family photo</li>
            <li>They spend more time choosing fonts than debugging their code (whatever that means)</li>
            <li>They've suddenly developed opinions about your living room furniture arrangement</li>
            <li>They listen to something called "lo-fi" while coding (it sounds like elevator music with a beat - I checked!)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <h3>MAMA'S WARNING SIGN #2</h3>
            <p>If you find them spending more time on color palettes than actual coding, intervention may be necessary! I recommend unplugging the WiFi and suggesting they help you organize the Tupperware cabinet.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>What Can We Do About It?</h2>
        <p>After three emergency phone calls with my sister Bethanne (she works in "I-T" up in Charlotte), I've put together some wholesome alternatives to redirect our children:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Church Coding Camp</strong> - Our congregation just started a "Code for Christ" program where teens learn to make websites for mission trips. All colors are pre-approved by the pastor's wife.</li>
            <li><strong>Family Coding Night</strong> - Every Tuesday, we now have Tyler teach us something about coding. It keeps him grounded, and now I can fix my own Facebook when it gets the glitches!</li>
            <li><strong>Practical Projects</strong> - I've encouraged Tyler to make a digital cookbook for all my family recipes instead of that "mood board app" he was working on.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeout from Screens</strong> - Every day from 4-6pm is screen-free time. We either work on puzzles or tend to my hydrangeas.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="recipe">
            <h3>Mama's Debugging Banana Pudding</h3>
            <p>When your child is frustrated with their code, nothing helps reset their attitude like this family recipe!</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Vanilla wafers, bananas, instant pudding, whipped cream, prayer</p>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Layer everything in a pretty dish, refrigerate, and serve with a side of gentle conversation about their coding choices.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Final Thoughts from This Southern Mama's Heart</h2>
        <p>Y'all, I don't pretend to understand all this coding business. Back in my day, we passed notes on paper and the only thing that needed programming was the VCR. But I do know that our children need guidance through these modern challenges.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe vibe coding isn't the devil's work like my Aunt Mabel suggested at Sunday dinner. Maybe it's just another way these creative young minds express themselves. But as parents, it's our job to make sure they don't lose sight of what really matters: a strong work ethic, practical skills, and knowing which fork to use at Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "The Lord works in mysterious ways, but code should work in logical ones!"
        </div>
        
        <p>If your child is deep into vibe coding, don't despair! Keep those lines of communication open wider than my front door at a summer barbecue. Ask questions, show interest, and gently guide them toward a healthy balance.</p>
        
        <p>And remember - this too shall pass. Last year Tyler was convinced he would make a living playing that Fortnite game, and now he barely mentions it!</p>
