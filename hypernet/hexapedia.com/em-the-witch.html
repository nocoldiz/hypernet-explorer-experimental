                <p data-lang-key="p_teenage_intro">So apparently (according to Bubba and some OLD blog posts I found), I was this super weird teenager who was OBSESSED with becoming a witch! 🧙‍♀️ Like, not the cute Halloween costume kind - I mean REAL magic with sparkles and reality-bending and everything!</p>

                <p data-lang-key="p_teenage_attempts">From what I can piece together from my hypernet archives, I spent YEARS trying every spell I could find in dusty old books. I'm talking candles, crystals, dancing naked under the full moon (don't ask) - the whole nine yards! 🕯️💎🌕 But nothing worked! Magic was supposedly "dead" or whatever. BORING!</p>

                <p data-lang-key="p_meeting_bubba_intro">Then in late 1995, I met this TOTALLY BIZARRE mechanic guy called Bubba! 🔧 He had this beat-up van called "The Beast" and this weird glowy engine thingy that made reality go all wibbly-wobbly around it!</p>

                <p data-lang-key="p_meeting_bubba_details">Bubba says we met when I was trying to "ritually charge" my Nokia 3310 (don't laugh, those things are INDESTRUCTIBLE and I figured they HAD to be magical) near some power lines. His <a href="liminal-engine">Liminal Engine</a> was making the whole area go bananas, and apparently I just... walked right up to him and said "TEACH ME YOUR MAGIC PHONE MAN!" 📱✨</p>

                <p data-lang-key="p_bubba_friendship">We became best friends almost immediately! 🤝 I mean, when you find someone whose existence literally bends reality AND who doesn't think you're totally insane for wanting to be a witch, that's friendship material right there! Plus his chaos-immunity meant he could handle my... intensity. 😅 Romance? Ew, no thanks - I'm way too busy with MAGIC for all that mushy stuff! 🔮</p>

                <p data-lang-key="p_thatcher_training">She dragged me away from Bubba (😢) to this secret magical boot camp where she taught me REAL magic! Not the cutesy candle stuff - we're talking reality-warping, memory-crystallizing, timeline-manipulating SERIOUS business! 💎🌀</p>

                <p data-lang-key="p_current_relationship">Bubba and I are still best friends, thankfully! 💙 He remembers our whole friendship, but for me it's like meeting a really sweet stranger who insists we went on epic adventures together. He's been SO patient, telling me stories about our travels and showing me photos. Slowly, I'm starting to feel... something. Maybe not memory, but like emotional muscle memory of our friendship?</p>

                <p data-lang-key="p_current_future">I'm currently exploring <a href="ritual-island">Ritual Island</a> and testing my new powers. Every day I discover something new - sometimes about magic, sometimes about my past. It's like being a detective in your own life! 🔍</p>

                <p data-lang-key="p_current_warning">Oh, and if you're thinking about trying memory magic - DON'T! 🚫 Trust me, trading away pieces of yourself for power seems cool until you wake up and can't remember why you love your favorite song. Some prices are too high, even for AWESOME magical abilities!</p>

                <p data-lang-key="p_current_contact">If you see me around the <a href="hypernet">Hypernet</a> or wandering the dimensions, say hi! I love meeting people, especially if they have stories about the "old Em." Just don't be weird about the whole god-killing thing, okay? 😅</p>
