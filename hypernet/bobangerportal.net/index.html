            <h3>March 20, 2001 - "Internet Explorer and..."</h3>
            <p>So I'm trying to browse the web today and Internet Explorer decides to... why do people even use this garbage browser when Netscape is clearly... ugh, you probably use IE anyway, don't you?</p>
            
            <h3>March 18, 2001 - "Email Etiquette for..."</h3>
            <p>Received another email today with the subject line "FW: FW: FW: FUNNY JOKE!!!" and I'm thinking... do people not understand basic email courtesy or are they just... typical behavior from typical people.</p>
            
            <h3>March 15, 2001 - "Dial-up Connections and Why..."</h3>
            <p>My ISP decided to throttle my connection again today. 56k modem and it's running at... what's the point of having technology if companies are going to... you wouldn't understand the technical details anyway.</p>
            
            <h3>March 10, 2001 - "Y2K Panic Was..."</h3>
            <p>Remember all that Y2K hysteria? People stockpiling food and water because they thought computers would... meanwhile those of us who actually understand technology were... but no, everyone had to panic like complete idiots.</p>
            
            <h3>March 5, 2001 - "Web Design Trends That..."</h3>
            <p>Visited a website today with 47 animated GIFs and a MIDI file that auto-plays and... who designs this crap? Someone who clearly doesn't understand basic usability principles or... probably the same people who visit my site, honestly.</p>
