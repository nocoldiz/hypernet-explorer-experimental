Terms of Use:
You can only use those edits in an RPG Maker product and you have to have RPG Maker MZ. Free for non-commercial and commercial projects. You need to credit me!
You need to send me a copy of your finished game, if you do a commercial project.
Feel free to further edit everything, but do not share your edits or share my originals without my permission.
My resources can be used in NSFW and R rated games.

Please be aware that not every tile is plug and play, some images might have to be inserted first in a proper tileset format in order to work in your RPG Maker Project. There are free graphic softwares available that can do that like Gimp or Krita.

If you want to show your appreciation, I'm always grateful for feedback (even negative, don't be shy, I wanna improve) or screenshots of maps/scenes where you used my tiles.
You can post it in my MZ resource thread: https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/candacis-resources-for-mz.126137/
