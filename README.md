# Hypernet Explorer

![Hypernet Explorer Banner](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzIyNzUzODM1LnBuZw==/original/Bt%2Bs2X.png)

> An immersive-sim roguelike set in a weird and alternate 2001, where the Y2K bug shattered reality and erased most modern technology, that is slowly being rebuilt using magic and the occult.

## üéÆ Overview

Form a party to explore a **92 floor skyscraper** that barely holds the cosmos together or just get lost in alternate activities:
- Manage a cursed pizza place
- Become a certified tarot reader  
- Date yourself from another plane of existence
- Start your own space program
- Get filthy rich by manipulating the soul market
- Go bowling with your beloved cousin

Every boundary that once separated religion, science, finance and magic is now obsolete so... **do what thou wilt.**
